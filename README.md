# Virtual MAC address randomiser

Change your mac's virtual MAC address!
Useful for hiding your identity on networks, or appearing as a new device on a network that may have wifi caps.

## To run: 

- Download the script in this repo
- Navigate to the directory this script is contained in
- Run `./randomiseMAC.sh`
- You're good to go! (You should have to reconnect to whatever network you are trying to connect to as you are now seen as a different device)
-If you're having permission issues try running `chmod 757 randomiseMAC.sh`
